In designing databases, we begin by examining what?	business rules
ERD: What do business rules tell us?	what is/are important to an organization
A conceptual data model captures what?	the overall structure of entities and the relationships among them
ERD: definition of business rules	statements that define or constrain some aspect of the business
ERD: Business rules are expressed in terms that are what?	familiar to end users
ERD: Business rules are automated through what?	DBMS software
ERD: Business rules (...) business structure	assert
Business rules (...) or (...) business behavior	control, influence
ERD: seven traits of good business rules?	declarative, precise, atomic, consistent, expressible, distinct, and business-oriented
ERD: A declarative business rule?	focuses on the what, not how
ERD: A precise business rule?	has clear, agreed-upon meanings
ERD: An atomic business rule?	has one statement only
ERD: A consistent business rule?	Is internally and externally consistent
ERD: An expressible business rule?	uses structured, natural language
ERD: A distinct business rule?	is non-redundant
ERD: A business-oriented business rule?	Is understood by non-technical people
ERD: Data names should be related to?	business or organization
ERD: defintion of data definitions	explanation of a term or fact
ERD,datadef: definition of “term”	word or phase with specific meaning
ERD,datadef: definition of “fact”	association between two or more terms
ERD: guidelines for data definitions?	(1) gathered in conjunction with systems requirements, (2) accompanied by diagrams, (3) iteratively created and refined, and (4) achieved by consensus
A conceptual data model is a graphical model showing (...) and (...)	characteristics of entities, relationships among entities
A conceptual data model is independent of what three things?	(1) how the database will be stored, (2) the data model used to implement the database, and (3) the type of DBMS to be used
(...) is the most commonly used conceptual model	ERD
ERD stands for?	Entity-relationship model
ERD consists of what three things?	(1) entities, (2) relationships among entities, and (3) attributes of entities and relationships
ERD: definition of entity 	a person, place, object, event or concept that an organization wishes to maintain data about
ERD: How is an entity represented?	represented by a rectangle
ERD: definition of entity type	a collection of all occurences of a given type of entity
ERD: definition of entity instance	a single occurence of an entity type
ERD: An entity type is also called?	entity class
ERD: An entity type can have (...) instances	many
ERD: An entity should be something that will have many (...) in the database	instances
An entity should be something that will be composed of multiple (...)	attributes
An entity should be something that we are trying to (...) or (...)	model, represent
An entity should NOT be a (...) or (...) of the database system	user, output
ERD: definition of attribute	a property or characteristic of an entity or relationship type
ERD,attrclass: required vs (...)	optional
ERD,attrclass: (...) vs optional	required
ERD,attrclass: simple vs (...)	composite
ERD,attrclass: (...) vs composite	simple
ERD,attrclass: single-valued vs (...)	multi-valued
ERD,attrclass: (...) vs multi-valued	single-valued
ERD,attrclass: stored vs (...)	derived
ERD,attrclass: (...) vs derived	stored
ERD: five classifications of attributes?	(1) required vs optional, (2) simple vs composite, (3) single-valued vs multi-valued, (4) stored vs derived, and (5) identifiers
ERD: definition of composite attributes	attributes broken into component parts
ERD: The parts of a composite attribute are enclosed in what?	parentheses
ERD: definition of multi-valued attributes	attributes having more than one value for each entity instance
ERD: A multi-valued attribute is enclosed in what?	curly braces
ERD: definition of derived attributes	attributes whose values can be calculated from other attribute values
ERD: A derived attribute is enclosed in what?	square brackets
ERD: An identifier is also called what?	a primary key
ERD: definition of identifier/key	an attribute (or combination of multiple) that uniquely identifies individual isntances of an entity type
ERD: definition of candidate identifier/key	an attribute that could be a key
ERD: If an identifier is unique, then that means...?	no two entity instances can have the same value for the identifier
ERD: An identifier should not change in (...)	value
ERD: For identifiers, substitute (...) keys for (...) keys	new and simple, long and composite
ERD: Time-stamping leads to a (...) and (...) attribute	multi-valued, composite
ERD: definition of values	the value of the type of characteristic that an attribute represents
The ERD contains only the attribute (...) and not its (...)	type, values
ERD: definition of relationship	a natural association/link between the instances of one or more entities
ERD: How is relationship represented?	by a line that connects entities
ERD: relationship type is between entity (...)	types
ERD: relationship instance is between specific entity (...)	instances
ERD: definition of relationship degree	the number of entity types that participate in the relationship
ERD: the most common relationship degrees?	unary, binary, and ternary
ERD,rshipdeg: definition of unary relationship	a recursive relationship within a single entity
ERD,rshipdeg: definition of binary relationship	an association between two entity types
ERD,rshipdeg: definition of ternary relationship	an association among three entity types
ERD: the three relationship cardinalities?	One-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many
ERD,rshipcard: definition of optional relationship	instance of one entity may not be associated with instance of related entity
ERD,rshipcard: definition of mandatory relationship	every instance in one entity type msut be associated with at least one instance in related entity
ERD,rship: definition of cardinality constraints	number of instances of one entity that can/must be associated with each instance of another entity
ERD,rshipcardcon: definition of minimum cardinality	if zero, optional relationship. If 1+, mandatory relationship
ERD,rshipcardcon: definition of maximum cardinality	maximum number of instances that can be involved in the relationship
